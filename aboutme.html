    <p class="center large"> <p class="brownbackground"> Since I was young, I've always had a passion for drawing and painting. The subject matter did not matter, as long as I was exercised in hand and eye coordination. I progress from drawing fruit and vegetables to environments later to the human figure.
    It was while studying in college at A Midsummer break, at a country fair in my local area. In the country fair I had my own store selling on the spot portraits. Much to my surprise, customers brought their pets as well, which challenged me at the time. That event intrigued my interest of painting wildlife and pets. Over the years Iâ€™ve honed my skills and am lucky enough to reaches a level where my passion has become my work as well.
